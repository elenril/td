Overview
========

TD is a project for task/todo list management. It consists of:
- A specification describing how tasks are stored in a repository. It is
  intended to be stable, so that other independent tools can be written to
  manipulate the tasks.
- A Python library for accessing the task repository compliant to the above
  specification.
- A CLI tool for managing tasks based on this library.

Several aspects of TD are strongly inspired by the Taskwarrior project
(https://taskwarrior.org/). See a following section for a more detailed
treatment of the differences.

TD vs. Taskwarrior
==================
TD has very similar goals to the Taskwarrior project -- both are text-based
command line task managers. So naturally one must ask why does TD exist and why
did its author not improve Taskwarrior instead.

It is the view of the author of TD that Taskwarrior, though a great tool doing
many things right, has some fundamental flaws that cannot be fixed by
incremental improvements. The main ones are:
- The choice of language -- TD's author strongly dislikes C++ and believes it is
  too low-level for such a project.
- The way the tasks are stored is problematic in many ways:
    * The storage format is not specified/documented and the only proper way to
      manipulate the tasks is with the task tool, which is problematic for
      building GUI frontends.
    * The storage format is unfriendly toward standard text processing tools.
    * Full history, crucial for this kind of project, is not preserved. While it
      is possible to use version control tools, such as git, to preserve full
      history, the task tool is not designed for it. Such history is then mostly
      unreadable.
    * The official recommended way of synchronization between multiple machines
      is the dedicated taskd server. This means additional complexity and an
      extended attack surface, bad for security and usability.
- Taskwarrior is beginning to suffer from feature creep, adding features that
  should more appropriately be handled by external tools.
