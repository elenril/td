Task searching/filtering
========================
Several commands accept a "filter expression" that is used to select the tasks
the command acts upon. This document describes the syntax of those expressions.

The expression is composed of zero or more terms joined together with operators
and parentheses '()' that override the evaluation order.

The operators are either unary or binary. Unary operators have one operand, the
subexpression immediately following the operator. Binary operators have two
operands, the first one preceding the operator, the second one following it.
Unary operators are:
- 'not' -- matches if the operand subexpression does not match
Binary
- 'and' -- matches if both operands match
- 'or'  -- matches if at least one of the operands matches

The base terms are all of the form <key>:<value> and match tasks with property
<key> equal to <value. Specifically, the base terms are:
- 'uuid:<uuid>'      -- matches the task with the specified UUID equal to <uuid>
- 'id:<id>'          -- matches the task with the specified short ID equal to <id>
- 'text:<text>'      -- matches when the task text contains <text>
- 'created:<date>'   -- matches when the task creation date is <date>
- 'due:<date>'       -- matches when the task due date is <date>
- 'scheduled:<date>' -- matches when the task scheduled date is <date>
- 'tag:<tag>'        -- matches when the task is tagged with <tag> or its subtag
- 'flag:blocked'     -- matches when the task is blocked (i.e. it depends on at
                        least one pending task)
- 'flag:blocking'    -- matches when the task is blocking (i.e. when at least
                        one pending task depends on it)
- 'urgency.above:<val>' -- matches when the task's urgency is above/below <val>
  'urgency.below:<val>'

In addition to the base terms there are the shortcut terms, which allow writing
some common filters in a shorter way. Those are:
- '<n1>,<n2>,<n3>,...' -- a comma-separated list of integers <nx>. Equivalent to
    '( id:<n1> or id:<n2> or id:<n3> ... )', i.e. matches the tasks with the
    short IDs <n1>, <n2>, <n3> and so on.
- '+tag1,tag2,...' -- equivalent to '( tag:tag1 or tag:tag2 ... )', i.e. matches
    the tasks with at least one of the specified tags.
- '<text>' with <text> not conforming to any of the above shortcuts --
    equivalent to 'text:<text>'.
